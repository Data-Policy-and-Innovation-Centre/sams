# Application - Enrollment 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check for disrepencies in applied_status and admission and enrollment
table(student_data_iti$admission_status,student_data_iti$enrollment_status)

# Applied_status and Admission_status Matrix
table(student_data_iti$applied_status, student_data_iti$admission_status)
# Above - (Yes,Yes) means applied and accepted. (Yes,No) means applied and rejected. (No,No) means did not apply so rejected. (No,Yes) is a puzzle. How can one not apply and get in? 


```
There is four columns with information on application and enrollment: 
application_status: Accepted/Pending 
applied_status: Yes/No
enrollment_status: Yes/No
admission_status: Yes/No

enrollment_status and admission_status are the same.
application_status and applied_status are equivalent (Accepted = Yes; Pending = No)

No in applied status probably means those who were not able to complete applying or did not pay the fees. (Confirm with CSM once) 

To calculate the count who did not get admission - Yes in applied status; No in enrollment_status
It is not sure among those who did not get admission whether they were rejected or did not accept. 

A categorical dummy can be made to indicate rejected applicants and accepted applicants. 
After that, a comparison between the two groups can be done based on various variables.
