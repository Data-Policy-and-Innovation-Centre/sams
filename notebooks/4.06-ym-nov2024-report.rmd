# The State of Vocational Training in Odisha

Vocational training in India has undergone a significant transformation, shaped by evolving socio-economic needs and government policies. During the pre-independence era, vocational education was largely informal, rooted in traditional crafts and agricultural practices tied to the caste system. Formal initiatives began under British rule, with the establishment of technical institutions like industrial schools to meet the workforce needs of colonial infrastructure projects.

Post-independence, the government prioritized vocational training to develop a skilled labor force for industrial growth. In 1950, Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) were introduced under the Craftsmen Training Scheme to standardize and expand technical education. The National Education Policy (NEP) of 1968 emphasized vocational education at the secondary level, aiming to integrate skill-based learning into mainstream education. This focus was reaffirmed in the 1986 NEP, which sought to divert 25% of higher secondary students into vocational streams.

The 2000s marked a new era with the rise of public-private partnerships and initiatives like the National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) in 2009. The Skill India Mission, launched in 2015, emphasized demand-driven skill development through private-sector collaboration and the establishment of Sector Skill Councils (SSCs). More recently, the NEP 2020 envisions integrating vocational training into mainstream education by exposing 50% of students to vocational skills by 2025.

Despite the increased focus on vocational training over time, skilling programs face challenges in achieving parity with traditional higher education. Government of Indiaâ€™s Skill India initiative aims to train millions in various skills to address youth unemployment and meet industrial demands. However, vocational training is often perceived as a fallback for those unable to pursue conventional academic pathways, leading to lower participation in vocational training programs.

Vocational training in Odisha mirrors broader challenges seen across India, including low societal acceptance and limited integration with mainstream education. Programs under Skill India, including Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), are active in Odisha, aiming to upskill youth. The state's Department of Skill Development and Technical Education (SDTE)  also runs its own schemes, such as the Sudakhya Scholarship scheme for female trainees and students, to incentivise participation in vocational training. Nevertheless, only a small proportion of students choose to enter the vocational training pipeline in the state. 

For those who choose to enter the vocational training pipeline, they have a few options, which we describe below.

## Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs)
ITIs in Odisha provide skill development programs that focus on trades like electrical, mechanical fitting, plumbing, welding, and computer hardware, among others. These institutes are spread across urban and rural areas to cater to the local population, with both government-run and private ITIs available.

```{r ITI location map, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="ITI locations by type of institution and enrollment (2023)", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(paths$FIGURES_DIR,"map_itis_by_type_2023.png"))
```


**Minimum Educational Qualification**: The candidate should have either passed or failed the class 10th board exam. Before 2024, even 8th standard students were eligible to enroll in certain trades. This has been phased out in the current academic year.

**Course Duration**: ITIs generally offer training programs that range from 6 months to 2 years, depending on the trade.

## Diploma Programs

Diploma programs in Odisha, primarily offered by polytechnic institutes, are designed to provide a deeper level of technical education in fields such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. These programs focus on the theoretical and practical aspects of various technical subjects. While they have a greater theoretical focus in engineering than ITI programs, the programs provide less foundational theoretical training than engineering degree programmes offered by universities.

* Map of Diploma Locations


**Minimum Educational Qualification**: A candidate must have completed Class 10 (Secondary School Certificate or equivalent) for most diploma courses. Some advanced diploma programs may require completion of a related ITI or 12th standard equivalent qualification. The lower age limit of students ranges from 14 to 16; there's no specified upper age limit. 

**Course Duration**: Diploma programs typically last for 3 years, although some institutes may offer shorter courses for specialized subjects or lateral entry for candidates with an ITI / 12th grade background. 

## Post-Diploma Programs
Post-Diploma programs in Odisha are designed for individuals who have completed a diploma in a specific technical field and wish to further specialize or enhance their skills in advanced areas such as automation, robotics, industrial safety, and other niche sectors. These programs focus on imparting higher-level skills that are in demand in industries.

**Minimum Educational Qualification**: Candidates must have completed a diploma in a relevant engineering or technical field from a recognized institution.
Age Limit: There is no specified age limit.

**Course Duration**: Post-Diploma programs typically span 6 months to 1 year, though some specialized programs may extend longer depending on the curriculum and the institution offering the course.

# An overview of SAMS

The Student Academic Management System (SAMS) is a digital platform developed and deployed by the Government of Odisha to streamline the admission and administration processes across various levels of education in the state. It serves as a one-stop solution for managing academic workflows, primarily focusing on admissions, academic tracking, and data management. Initially introduced in 2010 for higher secondary education, SAMS has expanded to encompass higher education and vocational training, making it a pivotal tool for educational governance in Odisha.

## Key features

* Centralized Admission Process
      SAMS facilitates online applications for admissions across higher secondary schools, colleges, ITIs, and vocational training institutions. This unified system ensures:

    * Transparency in the selection process.
    * Equal access to educational opportunities.
    * Minimization of manual intervention and associated errors.

* Multi-Tier Educational Coverage
    The platform covers the following educational sectors:

    * Higher Secondary Education (Class XI-XII): Admissions into schools offering Science, Commerce, and Arts streams.
    * Higher Education (Undergraduate Programs): Colleges offering general and professional degree programs.
    * Vocational and Skill-Based Training: Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and Diploma courses in engineering and other trades.
    * Post-Diploma and Advanced Courses: Specialized technical and professional courses.

* End-to-End Digital Process
  SAMS integrates and digitizes the student application experience:

    * Digital registration and application submission.
    * Real-time merit-based seat allocation.

## The SAMS database as a resource for policy analysis

SAMS has proven to be a transformative tool for streamlining admissions across various levels of education in Odisha. It has successfully automated processes, enhanced transparency, and lessened the administrative burden on individual institutions. However, while the platform hosts a rich repository of data on student demographics, academic performance, enrollment patterns, and institutional capacities, this information remains underutilized for analytics-driven decision-making and policy formulation.

The primary focus of SAMS has been operational, such as managing admissions and tracking seats across institutions. However, the data generated from these processes is rarely used to identify trends or address systemic issues in education. Despite the capability to generate real-time reports, the data is seldom used to monitor emerging trends or respond proactively to challenges, such as the underutilization of seats in certain programs and regional / socioeconomic disparities in access to training.

# Analysis of SAMS Data

<!-- Our goal with this report is to highlight the richness of the SAMS data and its ability to serve as a focal resource for generating high-quality evidence on the performance of vocational training programs in the state. We will focus on a few key metrics, such as enrollment trends, demographic characteristics, student academic performance before enrollment, along with institute level statistics on capacity and seat utilization. Our hope is that this analysis will help convince key stakeholders of the value of administrative data in policy-making and help us build a rich data-ecosystem to develop further analytics and generate more evidence. -->

This report highlights the richness of SAMS data as a resource for generating high-quality evidence on vocational training in Odisha. Focusing on key metrics like enrollment trends, demographics, pre-enrollment academic performance, and institute-level capacity and seat utilization, we aim to showcase its potential for policy-making. By demonstrating the value of administrative data, we hope to inspire stakeholders to support building a robust data ecosystem for deeper analytics and evidence generation.

## The vocational training pipeline

As discussed earlier, vocational training opportunities in Odisha primarily become available after students complete 10th grade. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the extent to which students opt for vocational training immediately after their 10th exams. This analysis provides key insights into the popularity and acceptance of vocational education in the state, and helps characterize the pipeline of vocational training in the state. As we show, the pipeline largely consists of students who have taken breaks in their formal education path and are now seeking vocational training opportunities. 


```{r Load exhibits, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

```


```{r Pipeline of vocational training, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, table.label="tab:pipeline"}

html_table <- pipeline %>% kable( caption = "Pipeline of vocational training") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)


```

```{r Compute stats for pipeline, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

pct_vocational_2023 <- round(pipeline$`ITI.admitted.(%)`[6] + pipeline$`Diploma.admitted.(%)`[6])

```

In Table *insert ref*, we see that vocational training attracts a small proportion of 10th standard students in the year they complete their board exam. Indeed, only  `r pct_vocational_2023`% of 10th standard students taking their board exam in 2023 end up in either ITI or Polytechnic Diploma programs. In fact, a plurality of students at ITIs joined their program 1-3 years *after* they had finished 10th standard. While the proportion of "assumed dropouts" -- the collection of students who leave the formal educational pipeline -- has been falling in recent years, most students still opt for higher secondary education over vocational training.

```{r Gap between 10th and enrollment (ITI), include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
html_table <- gaps_between_10th_enrollment %>% kable(
  caption = "Gap between 10th and ITI enrollment"
) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)


```

Despite enrolling a small proportion of 10th standard students, enrollment in ITIs has risen steadily since SAMS began recording applications in 2017. This increase is notable since the number of institutions has remained relatively stable over this period. The data show that this increase is largely driven by increased enrollment at government-run ITIs in the state.


```{r ITI enrollments and institutes, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
html_table <- iti_institutes_enrollments_over_time %>% kable(
  caption = "ITI enrollment and institutes over time"
) %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)

```


```{r Share of government vs private students over time, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plot_data <- iti_type_shares_over_time %>% select(Year, `Pvt.(%)`, `Govt.(%)`) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=c("Pvt.(%)","Govt.(%)"),
    names_to = "Type",
    values_to = "Share"
  )
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Year, y = Share, color = Type, group = Type)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic(base_size = 15) + 
  labs(
    title = "Enrollment Share Over Time",
    subtitle = "Government vs Private Institutions",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Enrollment (%)",
    color = "Institution Type"
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18, hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2017, 2024, by = 1))


```

One reason for the increase in enrollment at government ITIs is the availability of a wide range of trades offered. Indeed, all of the top 10 ITIs by trades offered in 2023 are government-run, with the largest ITI by enrollment, ITI Berhampur, offering 25 trades in 2023. In contrast, the largest private ITI by enrollment, the Rairangapur Industrial Training Centre, offered only 4 trades in 2023. The highest number of trades offered by private ITI in 2023 was 7 at the Balasore Technical School.

```{r Top 10 ITIs by num. of trades offered, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
html_table <- top_10_itis_by_num_trades_2023 %>% kable( caption = "Top 10 ITIs by num. trades offered in 2023") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)


```

As Tables *insert_ref* and *insert_ref* together show, the enrollment numbers and the number of trades offered remain highly correlated, despite the fact that the majority of students in Odisha opt for just two trades: electrician and fitter (see Table *insert_ref*). This suggests that institutions with more trades perhaps also offer higher quality faciltiies, training, and placement opportunities, and thus attract more students.

```{r Top 10 ITIs by enrollment, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
html_table <- top_10_itis_by_enrollment_2023 %>% kable( caption = "Top 10 ITIs by enrollment in 2023") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)

```

* Do private ITIs offer more non Electrician, Fitter type trades?

```{r Top 10 trades, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
html_table <- top_10_trades_by_enrollment_2023 %>% kable( caption = "Top 10 trades by enrollment in 2023") %>%

ITIs and Polytechnics in Odisha attract a large number of students from all over the state. With the growing need for skilled professionals, students from both urban and rural areas of Odisha are seeking admission to these institutions. The state's diverse demographic, spanning from metropolitan areas like Bhubaneswar and Cuttack to more remote regions, results in a wide geographic representation of students in these training programs. In addition to students from within Odisha, ITI and Polytechnic diploma training institutions in the state attract candidates from other parts of India as well, although they comprise a small proportion of enrolled students and trainees.

below_100_iti <- iti_annual_income_over_time %>% mutate(
  share_below_100 = round(`0-1,00,000` / (`0-1,00,000` + `1,00,000-2,50,000` + `2,50,000.-.6,00,000` + `Above.6,00,000` + OTHER) * 100, digits = 0)
)

below_100_iti_2023 <- below_100_iti$share_below_100[8]

below_250_diploma <- diploma_annual_income_over_time %>% mutate(
  share_below_250 = round(`0-2,50,000`/ (`0-2,50,000` + `2,50,000-8,00,000` + `Above.8,00,000` + `OTHER`) * 100, digits = 0)
)

below_250_diploma_2023 <- below_250_diploma$share_below_250[7]


```


Despite the diversity in the geographic origin of vocational students, students are largely homogenous in their economic circumstances: as Table *insert_ref* shows, roughly `r below_100_iti_2023`% of students enrolled in ITIs in 2023 had a family income below INR 1,00,000 per year or approximately 60% of the per capita income in the state. For polytechnic students, the income data is less granular; still, we see that roughly `r below_250_diploma_2023` % of Diploma students in 2023 had family incomes below INR 2,50,000 per year. This is a trend that has held over time, suggesting that vocational training has largely been the preserve of students from economically marginal families.


```{r ITI Annual income over time, echo=FALSE }
html_table <- iti_annual_income_over_time %>% kable(
  caption = "Income categories for ITI students over time"
) %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

  caption = "Income categories for Diploma students over time"
) %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)

```

On the other hand, as Table *insert_ref* shows, the reservation policies of the state have ensured a more equitable representation of castes groups in vocational programs. Approximately 40% of the ITI trainees in 2023 come from SC/ST backgrounds, which is roughly commensurate with their share in the overall population of Odisha. In Polytechnic diploma programs, SC/ST students comprise roughly 30% of enrolled students in 2023.


```{r ITI Social category over time, echo=FALSE}
html_table <- iti_social_category_over_time %>% kable(caption = "Social category of enrolled ITI students over time") %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)


```

Nevertheless, across all caste groups, the lowest income students tend to enroll in vocational programs.

### Gender and the Sudakhya scheme

*Section to be written*
 
## Academic background of enrolled vocational students


```{r Load individual level exhibits, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
path = file.path(paths$TABLES_DIR, "individual_level_exhibits.xlsx")
sheet_names = getSheetNames(path)

iti_pass_by_gender <- read.xlsx(

  path,
  sheet_names[4]
)

diploma_highest_qual_by_gender <- read.xlsx(
  path,
  sheet_names[5]
)


```


Vocational students at ITIs and Polytechnic programs tend to come from different academic backgrounds. While ITI trainees predominantly have a 10th pass background, Polytechnic diploma students are admitted in two tracks: "fresh entry" diploma matriculants typically have a 10th pass background, while "lateral entry" students have an ITI or 12th pass background. Lateral entry students are typically allowed to join a diploma programme in the second year, allowing them to skip the basic courses taught in the first two semesters. As such, we see a that 


```{r ITI highest qualifications by gender, echo=FALSE}
html_table <- iti_highest_qual_by_gender %>% kable(caption = "ITI highest qualifications by gender (2023)") %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)

```


```{r Diploma highest qualifications by gender, echo=FALSE}
html_table <- diploma_highest_qual_by_gender %>% kable(caption = "Diploma highest qualifications by gender (2023)") %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)

```


As we had noted earlier, ITI and Fresh-entry Diploma students are selected on the basis of their 10th grade marks; as such, in Figures *add_ref*, we see almost the full spectrum of marks represented at vocational institutes, with the modal student scoring 33% (the passing threshold in most board exams). We believe that the concentration around the passing threshold is a phenomenon in the overall distribution of marks among 10th students, largely due to lenient marking for students who are just failing, as opposed to being a feature of the academic profile of vocational students in particular. 

Diploma students have performed marginally better in 10th board exams than ITI students; the former have scored 50% on average, whereas the latter have scored 57% on average. The main distinguishing feature of Diploma students is that they can enter programs either directly using their 10th grade marks (called "Fresh" entry) or join in the 3rd semester as Lateral entry students, provided they have completed either 12th grade or an ITI course. 


```{r ITI marks histogram, echo=FALSE}

```{r Diploma marks histogram, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(paths$FIGURES_DIR,"hist_diploma_marks_2023.svg"))

```


Some ITI trades allow trainees who have failed their 10th board exam to enroll in their program anyway. Nevertheless, the vast majority of students enrolled at ITIs have passed their 10th exam, with no significant (*do test? statistical tests tend to be significant due to sample sizes but that does not imply substantive significance*) variation in pass-rates between male and female trainees.  

```{r Share 10th pass by gender among ITI students, echo=FALSE}

print_table_to_word(html_table)

``` 
-->



## Institutes
In vocational training institutions, just like in higher education, the process of setting cutoffs for admission is a key mechanism for managing the demand for limited seats in specific courses. These institutions face a diverse pool of applicants with varying academic backgrounds, socio-economic conditions, and preferences for trades and courses. The reservation policy of the state and the centre mandate allotment of seats by gender and social category, which then in turn determine the cutoffs in combination with demand for seats. 

```{r Load insitutes level exhibits, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
path = file.path(paths$TABLES_DIR, "institute_level_exhibits.xlsx")
sheet_names = getSheetNames(path)

iti_berhampur_cutoffs <- read.xlsx(
  path,
  sheet_names[1]
)

iti_cuttack_cutoffs <- read.xlsx(
  path,
  sheet_names[2]
)

```

In Tables *insert_ref*, we see the gender and social-category wise cutoffs for Electrician and Fitter trades offered at both ITI Berhampur and ITI Cuttack. These are two of the most popular trades across the state and the institutes are one of the largest by enrollment. As we can see, there is substantial variation in the cutoff percentages across gender and caste groups. The corresponding variation in average student marks in each category is much lower, suggesting that perhaps cutoffs are not set optimally.  


```{r ITI Berhampur cutoffs, echo=FALSE}
html_table <- iti_berhampur_cutoffs %>% kable(caption = "ITI Berhampur cutoffs (2023)") %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)

```


```{r ITI Cuttack cutoffs, echo=FALSE}
html_table <- iti_cuttack_cutoffs %>% kable(caption = "ITI Cuttack cutoffs (2023)") %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

print_table_to_word(html_table)

```




Suboptimally allocating seats across trades and branches in vocational training institutions can lead to significant inefficiencies, with some trades experiencing oversubscription while others face large vacancies. In popular trades like electrician and fitter, the demand for seats often exceeds availability, resulting in higher competition and oversubscription, particularly when reservation policies are miscalibrated fail to account for gender or category imbalances. This can overwhelm institutional resources and extend waiting times for students. Conversely, less popular trades may suffer from low demand and large vacancies too many seats are allocated to them relative to demand, leading to underutilization of resources and missed opportunities for both students and institutions. Ensuring an accurate, data-driven approach to seat allocations is essential for maintaining balance and aligning training programs with market needs. 

As shown in Figures *insert_ref*, we see marked variation in the extent to which seats are left vacant in vocational training institutes in the state. In particular, while public ITIs are largely able to fill seats, private ITIs are often left with large vacancies. The exact cause for this is unclear, but it is likely that many private ITIs offer lower quality / more expensive programs, and do not provide good job market outcomes relative to public ITIs.
