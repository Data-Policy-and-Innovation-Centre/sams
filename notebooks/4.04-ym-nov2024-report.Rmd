# Executive summary

# An overview of SAMS

## Enrollment

## Institutes

## Trades

# The vocational training pipeline

# Student demographics

# Student qualifications and marks

# The geography of vocational training








<!-- # Goals for the report
The long-term goal of this analysis is to uncover motivations and patterns behind studentsâ€™ enrollment in vocational training program and uncover factors influencing choice based on gender and social demographics. Of principal interest to us is

* What types of students decide to enroll in vocational training programs?
    * This ideally requires data on enrollment in higher education / 12th grade programs as well

* Are there "overqualified" students enrolling in vocational programs?

* Does distance from training institutes act as a binding constraint on students?
    * Are some students unable to enroll in the trades / institutions they would like because of a long commute?
    * Hostel facilities are likely to play a role in this.

* Are there certain trades that are "oversubscribed", in that the government has not provided enough seats in those trades despite demand?
    * Conversely, are some other trades "undersubscribed", and perhaps resources are better allocated in other trades?

The following exhibits serve as a scoping exercise for the report due at the end of the month. -->

# Raw exhibits

* We are likely to find some trades where students are "overqualified". 

```{r Highest qualifications raw, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

* Some trades show a particularly high share of graduates
    * These appear to be female dominated trades

  theme_classic() 
  

```

```{r Average marks by trade, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
marks_by_trade %>% head(20) %>% kable( caption = "Summary statistics on marks by trade") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

```



```{r Average marks by gender and category within trade, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data <- iti_marks_and_cutoffs_2023
iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data$gender <- relevel(factor(iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data$gender),ref="Male")

iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data$social_category <- relevel(factor(iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data$social_category),ref="UR")

iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data$trade <- relevel(factor(iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data$trade),
                                               ref = "Electrician (NSQF)")
iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data <- iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data %>% 
  mutate(
    coarse_board = case_when(
      grepl("Odisha",highest_qualification_exam_board) ~ "BSE Odisha",
      grepl("Central", highest_qualification_exam_board) ~ "CBSE",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  )
iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data$coarse_board <- relevel(factor(iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data$coarse_board),ref = "Other")

model1 <- lm(percentage ~ gender + social_category, data = iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data)
model2 <- lm(percentage ~ gender + social_category + trade, data=iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data)
model3 <- lm(percentage ~ gender + social_category + coarse_board + trade, data=iti_marks_gender_cat_reg_data)
summary(model3)






```


* While the vast majority of students come from the Odisha state board, we see some other boards like CBSE as well

```{r Boards, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
boards_marks %>% head(5) %>% kable(caption = "Summary statistics on marks by board") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
  

  

```

* We can summarize average marks by social category and demographics, within different trades and different boards by running a fixed-effects regression. 

* The goal here is to *summarize* data; we do not treat the models themselves seriously.

```{r Stargazer of marks on demographics by trade, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
model_results <- stargazer(model1, model2, model3, omit="^trade",
          type = "html",          # Use "text" for console, "html" for HTML output in RMarkdown
          title = "Marks by demographic characteristics",
          dep.var.labels = c("Marks (%)"),
          covariate.labels = c("Female", "Green Card", "Phys. Disabled", "Scheduled Caste", "Scheduled Tribe", "BSE Odisha", "CBSE"),
          out.header = FALSE,
          align = TRUE,
          no.space = TRUE,
          star.cutoffs = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001))
```

* The estimated models have the same specifications in demographics
    * Model (2) uses within trade estimates (trade fixed-effects).
    * Model (3) = Model (2) + board fixed effects where we have classified the boards into "BSE Odisha", "CBSE", and "Other".
    * The constant in model (1) represents average marks for unreserved male students.
    * The constant in model (2) represents average marks for unreserved male students in the electrician trade.
    * The constant in model (3) represents average marks for unreserved male students in the electrician trade who graduated from some "Other" board.
* The model is missing interaction terms, which is why the coefficient estimates may not add up to within gender X category means.

### Cutoffs

Average cutoffs are low throughout ITIs 

```{r Average cutoffs by trade and demographics, echo=FALSE,include=TRUE}
cutoffs_trade_demographics %>% head(10) %>% kable(caption = "Average cutoffs by trade and social category in 2023") %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))


```

```{r Average cutoffs by trade and gender, echo=FALSE,include=TRUE}
cutoffs_trade_gender %>% head(10) %>% kable(caption = "Average cutoffs by trade and social category in 2023") %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))


```

Now we can use the fixed-effects regression approach as before to also look at how cutoffs differ between private and government ITIs.

```{r Average cutoffs by trade, gender, demographics, and type of institute, echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}

# Coarsen up social category
iti_cutoffs_2023 <- iti_cutoffs_2023 %>% mutate(
  coarse_cat = case_when(
    social_category == "SC" ~ "SC",
    social_category == "ST" ~ "ST",
    social_category == "UR" ~ "UR",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  )
)

# Set up levels
iti_cutoffs_2023$coarse_cat <- relevel(factor(iti_cutoffs_2023$coarse_cat), ref="UR")
iti_cutoffs_2023$gender <- relevel(factor(iti_cutoffs_2023$gender), ref="Male")
iti_cutoffs_2023$type_of_institute <- relevel(factor(iti_cutoffs_2023$type_of_institute), ref="Pvt.")
iti_cutoffs_2023$trade <- relevel(factor(iti_cutoffs_2023$trade), ref= "Electrician (NSQF)")

# Estimate models
model1 <- lm(cutoff ~ type_of_institute + gender, iti_cutoffs_2023)
model2 <- lm(cutoff ~ type_of_institute + gender + coarse_cat, iti_cutoffs_2023)
model3 <- lm(cutoff ~ type_of_institute + gender + coarse_cat + trade, iti_cutoffs_2023)




```


```{r Stargazer of cutoffs on social category, gender, trade, and type, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
model_results <- stargazer(model1, model2, model3, omit="^trade",
          type = "html",          # Use "text" for console, "html" for HTML output in RMarkdown
          title = "Cutoffs by social category, gender, trade, and type in 2023",
          dep.var.labels = c("Marks (%)"),
          covariate.labels = c("Govt.", "Female", "Other","SC", "ST"),
          out.header = FALSE,
          align = TRUE,
          no.space = TRUE,
          star.cutoffs = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001))
```




The uniformly low *average* cutoffs obscure the variation in cutoffs across institutes and trades. The distribution of cutoffs for general, male candidates suggests that there's substantial heterogeneity in institutional quality and trade competitiveness.

```{r Variation in cutoffs, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
cutoffs_ur_male <- iti_cutoffs_2023 %>% filter(coarse_cat == "UR", gender == "Male")
var_cutoffs <- sd(cutoffs_ur_male$cutoff)
var_cutoffs <- sprintf("%.1f",var_cutoffs)

ggplot(cutoffs_ur_male, aes(x = cutoff)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 10,                 # Set bin width
    fill = "#4C72B0",             # Color for the bars
    color = "black",              # Outline color
    alpha = 0.8                   # Transparency
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of cutoffs for general male candidates",
    x = "Cutoff (%)",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) + theme_minimal()

```


The standard deviation of the cutoff distribution is `r var_cutoffs`.



## Distance from home


```{r Load tables for distance analysis, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
distance_excel_path <- file.path(paths$TABLES_DIR, "distance.xlsx")
sheet_names <- getSheetNames(distance_excel_path)
distance_by_type <- read.xlsx(
  distance_excel_path,
  sheet_names[1]
)

```

```{r Summary stats on distance by type of institute, echo=FALSE,include=TRUE}
distance_by_type %>% kable(caption="Summary stats on distance from home")  %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))


```

Students travel slightly longer distances to private ITIs; this could be because public ITIs are even further away. It could also suggest that they are not eligible for public ITIs / trades that they are interested in.

```{r Density of distance to ITI, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(iti_enrollments_2023, aes(x=distance, fill="red")) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +
  theme_minimal() + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0, 500)) +
  labs(title="Density of Distance between home and institute", x="Distance in Kilometers", y="Density") + guides(fill="none")

```

```{r Density of distance by type, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(iti_enrollments_2023, aes(x=distance, fill=type_of_institute)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +
  theme_minimal() + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0, 500)) +
  labs(title="Density of Distance between home and institute", x="Distance in Kilometers", y="Density") + labs(fill = "Type of institute")

```

We can examine the dynamics of the length of commute over time

```{r Distance over time, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(iti_enrollments, aes(x = academic_year, y = distance)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +  
  coord_trans(y = "log10") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average distance travelled (km)") +
  theme_minimal()


```

We see a small decline in the length of commute which seems largely unrelated to a change in the number of institutes; indeed the number of institutions has remained roughly flat since 2018

```{r Number of institutes, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
num_institutes <- iti_enrollments %>% distinct(sams_code, academic_year, type_of_institute) %>% filter(academic_year > 2017)

ggplot(num_institutes, aes(x=academic_year, fill = type_of_institute)) +
  geom_bar()  + scale_fill_brewer("Dark2", name= "Type of institute") + labs(x = "Year", y = "Num. institutes", fill = "Type of institute") +
  theme_minimal()

```


Different social groups may be disproportionately affected by the length of the commute.

```{r Distance travelled over time by social category, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
distance_over_time <- iti_enrollments %>% filter(gender %in% c("Male","Female"))
ggplot(distance_over_time, aes(x = academic_year, y = distance, color = social_category, group = social_category)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +  
  coord_trans(y = "log10") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average distance travelled (km)", color = "Social category") +
  theme_minimal()

```


```{r Distance travelled over time by gender, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(distance_over_time, aes(x = academic_year, y = distance, color = gender, group = gender)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +  
  coord_trans(y = "log10") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average distance travelled (km)", color = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal()
```
